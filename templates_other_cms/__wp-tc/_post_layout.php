      <p>As 2020 comes to a long-overdue close and we head into what anyone can hope will be a slightly less chaotic new year,
      it also edges closer to what will soon be two years leading product with Social Mobile. With the results of all the hard work
      now materialising, I think it’s interesting to reflect on the last >18 months, what it’s lead to, and what’s next.</p>

      <p>Note: The following is a personal take on a work-related topic. For normal Android Enterprise content, please head here.</p>

      <h2>The leadup</h2>
      <p>I’ve spent many years on the consumer end of Android, from devices purchased for my own use over the last decade, to those
      I’ve reviewed in an enterprise context through my efforts on Android Enterprise. I have, and still continue to engage with OEMs
      in the ecosystem for devices I test on a reasonably regular basis, pointing out issues with implementations, random bugs,
      offering advice where asked and so forth, but that’s typically where it stops; once I’ve said my bit the feedback is taken internally
      and tends to fall into the ether of internal triaging. If I’m lucky, a few weeks to a couple of months later I’ll get a ping to say a
      software update addresses previous concerns, but more often than not that doesn’t happen.</p>
      <h2>The leaddown</h2>
      <p>With the lack of transparency also comes a few other common experiences – OEMs move slowly. Their engineering teams are
      inaccessible or don’t speak to outside parties. Enterprise concepts and/or best practices are either not known or not prioritised,
      and so on. Today in fairness it’s substantially better than it used to be through the education and motivation provided by
      programmes such as Android Enterprise Recommended, but I could still earn a decent living consulting for OEMs if desired.</p>
      <h3 id="1">R U listening</h3>
      <p>In any case, after years of telling OEMs how things should be done with zero experience of the processes on the other side, I’d
      often wondered what could really be involved in building Android devices, and if I could easily translate my knowledge of Android –
      both Enterprise, including best practices, custom APIs, device management, etc, as well as exposure to several years of
      communities such as XDA flashing ROMs and learning what tweaks to various rooted devices do what – to give me a solid rolling
      start on the parts I knew less about – GMS, certifications, hardware requirements, testing, building from AOSP, etc.</p>
